# Rock Paper Scissors
How skilled are you? Will you be able to beat your opponent? Rock, paper, or scissors is a game in which you will challenge your opponent. The rules are easy, choose one of those elements and find out who wins.
Remember, rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. You will have three rounds of three laps to guess who is the best!
